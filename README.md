# pce-associations

The aim of this repository is to maintain the PCE association-type used by ongoing implementations. 

 Each association-type value should be tracked with the following qualities:

   - Type
   - Name
   - Reference
   - Contact
   
This is a temporary repository, once the PCE association draft (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-pce-association-group/) becomes RFC and the IANA creates a sub-registory, this repository would be abandoned and the usual early allocation process should be used. 

### This MUST be done only for association-type that are implemented and would need to inter-operate.
